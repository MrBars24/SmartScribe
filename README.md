# SmartScribe
SmartScribe is an innovative mobile or web app designed to enhance the studying 
experience by leveraging the power of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and AI
based text generation. The app enables users to take pictures of their study notes, 
whether handwritten or printed, and transforms them into digital content that can 
be easily studied and reviewed.
